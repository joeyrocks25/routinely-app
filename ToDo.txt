Look at alternative methods to authentication such as 'OAuth2'
Down the line, is there an alternative to Express?
Rework design and responsiveness, eg smaller screen
If using localstorage for guest, limit goals to 3, there's a cap of storage (e.g. 5mb)
Is default button being used or just the css?
https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html -- add images to backend (quicker response times)
using localstorage now for token, however, should update to http-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
